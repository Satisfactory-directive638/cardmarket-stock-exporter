## [2.2.2] — 2026-05-06

Diagnostic release for extension-set bulk-update issue.

### Investigation

User-reported (LUPZN, follow-up): comment edits on extension/expansion sets (e.g. "Black Bolt JP: Ergänzungen", SetCode `x-...`) are silently skipped during bulk-update **even when the "Comments mit-updaten" toggle is ON** — regular sets get their comments updated correctly in the same run. The v2.2.1 silent-skip-warning fix did not address this case. Suspected root cause: the `/Modal/Article_EditArticleModal?idArticle=X` endpoint may return no edit-form for extension-article IDs → fetch returns null → status "not found" → row not applied. Cannot confirm without a DevTools network trace.

### Added — Diagnostics

- **Per-Expansion status breakdown** after analyze. Lists every expansion with a row count breakdown: ok / not-found / unchanged / capped. Surfaces patterns like "expansion X has 100% not-found" immediately.
- **Extension-set auto-detection** — expansions matching `/erg[äa]nzung|extension/i` with 100% not-found rows trigger a special diagnostic block requesting a DevTools network trace of the modal-load URL.
- **Sample articleIDs** for problematic expansions: prints first 3 `articleId / idProduct / language / condition / expansion` tuples for direct DevTools inspection.

## [2.2.1] — 2026-05-06

Defensive fix for users who forget the "Update comments" toggle.

### Fixed

- **Silent-skip of comment-only edits when "Update comments" toggle was OFF.** Pre-existing bug surfaced by LUPZN's investigation: the v2.1 Skip-Fetch optimization treated comment-only edits as "no change" when the toggle was off, even if the user had actually edited the Comments column. Now the analyzer detects when `Comments` differs from `_OriginalComments` even with the toggle off, counts those rows, and surfaces a loud red warning in the preview area listing affected articles. The user must now either enable the toggle or explicitly accept that comment edits will be ignored.
- Diagnostic logs now show up to 3 sample silent-skip cases with article ID, expansion, old comment, new comment for quick verification.

> Note: this fix is **defensive** — it does NOT address the toggle-ON extension-set bug. See v2.2.2 for that investigation.

## [2.2.0] — 2026-05-03

i18n release — UI now supports German + English with auto-detection from browser locale plus manual override toggle.

### Added

- **`_locales/de/messages.json` + `_locales/en/messages.json`** — Chrome standard i18n dictionaries with ~100 keys covering UI labels, buttons, hints, banners, progress text, and key log/error messages.
- **i18n.js** helper module — hybrid approach combining `chrome.i18n.getMessage()` (browser-locale-based) with `chrome.storage.local` override for in-popup language toggle.
- **🌐 UI Language toggle** in popup header — Auto / 🇩🇪 DE / 🇬🇧 EN. Override persists across sessions via `chrome.storage.local`.
- **`storage` permission** added to manifest for persisting the user's preferred UI language.

### Changed

- `manifest.json` — `name`, `description`, `default_title` now use `__MSG_*__` placeholders. `default_locale: "de"` set as fallback.
- `popup.html` — all visible UI strings (labels, buttons, hints, options) now carry `data-i18n*` attributes for runtime translation.
- `popup.js` — wired i18n init at startup, replaced key user-visible strings with `t()` helper calls (progress text, error logs, status banners, button labels).

### Compatibility

- Existing v2.1 installs auto-update without data loss. Stored UI language preference: defaults to "auto" (browser locale).
- Existing CSV exports remain compatible — CSV column structure unchanged.
- Some verbose internal log messages remain in German for v2.2 and will be fully translated in v2.3.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-04-29

Major release driven by community feedback from Reddit (r/Cardmarket) and direct user reports. Focus: hardening Bulk-Update against real-world edge cases + Want-Lists support + speed.

### Added — Stock Export

- **CSV Header Metadata**
  CSV files now begin with a comment line `# CMSE-META | exported=ISO | lang=XX | game=XX | tool=vX.Y.Z`. Used by Bulk-Update to detect tab-mismatch and stale-export warnings. Backwards compatible — old CSVs still parse fine.
- **`idProduct` column**
  New column extracted from row markup (multiple fallback sources: data attributes, hidden inputs, edit-link href, onclick blobs). Required for the new idArticle auto-rebind feature.
- **`SetCode` + `CollectorNumber` columns**
  Parsed from `ExpansionCode` (e.g. `sv2a 063` → `sv2a` + `063`). `ExpansionCode` is preserved for backwards compatibility. Handles edge formats like `001/250` and pure-numeric collector numbers.
- **Cascading Filter for >300-listing expansions**
  When an expansion's listings exceed Cardmarket's per-query cap (~300 with sortBy), the scraper now auto-splits by `idLanguage` → `idCondition` → `isReverseHolo` until each sub-query stays under the cap. Power sellers with thousands of variants per set will no longer silently lose entries.

### Added — Bulk Update

- **idArticle Auto-Rebind**
  When the price-fetch returns 404 for a stale `idArticle`, the tool now refetches `/Stock/Offers/Singles?idProduct={idProduct}` and tries to match an active listing on `(language, condition, isReverseHolo)`. Unique match → automatic rebind, original ID seamlessly replaced under the hood. Multi-match or no-match → kept as "not found" for safety. The preview UI shows a `↻NEW_ID` badge on rebound rows and a green banner with the rebind count.
- **Stale-Export Sanity Check**
  Two new warnings:
  - CSV older than 24h → `⚠ CSV ist Xh alt — empfohlen: vor Bulk-Update neu exportieren`
  - More than 5% of IDs not found after rebind attempts → recommendation to re-export
- **Tab-Mismatch Detection**
  Compares CSV's `lang`/`game` metadata against the active Cardmarket tab. Mismatch shows a confirm dialog before continuing — prevents the common failure mode of "exported from `/de/Pokemon/`, ran update on `/en/Magic/`, all 5000 IDs 404'd."
- **Comments Bulk-Edit**
  New "Comments mit-updaten" toggle. When enabled, abweichende `Comments` in the CSV are written back to Cardmarket along with prices. Safety default: empty CSV comments are ignored (won't accidentally wipe existing comments). Diff preview shows a second row per article when comments will change, with truncated old/new text and full text in the tooltip.
- **⚡ Fast Mode / Direct Mode (opt-in, recommended for >100 items)**
  Direct AJAX POST to `/{lang}/{game}/AjaxAction/Article_EditSingleArticle` — verified via DevTools network trace. Skips modal-fetch + modal-render + Bootstrap-init entirely. **1 POST per article instead of 2-3**. ~10× faster than modal-flow, ~70% less Cloudflare load. Eliminates "modal did not load form within 5s" errors entirely. Auto-fallback to modal-flow on any per-request error.
  **Production-verified:** 1201 cards price-update in single run with 0 errors using Fast Mode + Slow Mode (LUPZN, 2026-05-01). Second run: 1900+ cards Comments-bulk-update successful (LUPZN, 2026-05-02). Recommended setup for >1000 items: ⚡ Fast Mode + 🐢 Slow Mode + Pin-to-Window, **keep popup in foreground for the full run, do not use Cardmarket manually during the run** (no tab switching, no parallel edits).
- **🐢 Slow Mode (recommended for >500 items)**
  Reduces request rate to ~1 req/2s — stays under Cloudflare Bot Management thresholds. Sequential batches with explicit pauses. Trade-off: ~40 min wall-time for 1200 items, but bulletproof success rate. Auto-warns if >500 items submitted without Slow Mode active.
- **🛡️ Cloudflare Detection + Cascade-Abort**
  Detects CF challenge responses (status 403/520/521/522/524, body markers like "Just a moment", "Checking your browser"), backs off with exponential pause (5s/10s/15s/20s/up to 90s for CF-specific codes). If 20 consecutive fetch fails detected → auto-abort with clear recovery instructions (close tabs, wait 10-15 min, clear cookies, re-login, retry with Slow Mode).
- **♻️ Skip-Fetch Optimization**
  CSV exports now include `_OriginalPrice_EUR` + `_OriginalComments` reference columns. On re-import, only rows where the user actually edited a field get fetched from Cardmarket. 1500 rows with 50 edits → 50 fetches instead of 1500. Massive reduction in CF-load.
- **🎯 Set-Filter (pre-fetch)**
  After CSV analysis, a checkbox panel shows all expansions with their edit-counts + total card-counts. User can deselect sets to skip — selected-out sets are not fetched and not updated. Live-updates the [Bestätige Update]-button count as user toggles.
- **idProduct Recovery from Excel**
  Same scientific-notation salvage as `ArticleID` now applies to `idProduct` (Excel mangles long IDs into `1.23e+10` format).

### Added — Want-Lists (new feature)

- **Want-Lists Export**
  Brand-new `📋 Wants` tab. Auto-discovers all your wantlists from `/Wants`, then paginates each `/Wants/EditWantsList/{id}` to build a combined CSV. Columns: `WantListName, idWantsList, idProduct, idWant, ProductName, Expansion, ExpansionCode, Language, MinCondition, IsFoil, IsSigned, IsAltered, IsPlayset, IsReverseHolo, MaxPrice_EUR, Quantity, ProductUrl, delete`. Use case: cleaning up old wantlists after years of buying.
- **Want-Lists Bulk-Delete via CSV**
  Edit the exported CSV in Excel/Sheets, set `delete=Y` on rows you want gone, re-upload. Tool validates IDs, shows preview, requires confirmation before live delete. Dry-Run is on by default for safety.

### Changed

- **License: MIT → GPL-3.0** (relicensed starting v2.1). Forks and derivative Chrome Web Store uploads must now remain open-source under GPL-3.0 and disclose their source. Existing v1.0–v2.0 releases stay under MIT.
- `manifest.json` version bumped 2.0.0 → 2.1.0
- `parseCsv` now skips comment lines (lines starting with `#`) and surfaces metadata as third return value
- `scrapePages` signature changed from `(idExpansion, label, ...)` to `(filterObj, label, ...)` and returns `{added, capSuspect, totalPagesSeen, pagesFetched}` instead of just `added`. Driven by Cascading Filter requirements.

### Compatibility

- v2.0 CSVs (without `# CMSE-META` header, without `idProduct`/`SetCode`/`CollectorNumber` columns) still parse and bulk-update — `idProduct` will simply be empty for those rows, which means **no auto-rebind** is possible. Re-export with v2.1 is recommended for active sellers.
- New CSV columns are appended; existing column positions unchanged. Excel/Sheets workflows that reference columns by name continue to work.

### Known limitations

- **Popup must stay in foreground during Export/Bulk-Update — and Cardmarket must NOT be used manually during the run.** Chrome MV3 terminates popup-context on blur, killing the scrape/update loop silently. Manual Cardmarket activity (clicks, edits, second tab, mobile app) collides with scraper fetches (CSRF rotation, session conflicts, CF rate-spike) → run aborts. **Recommended setup:** open Cardmarket in one Chrome window (Tab A), click **📌 Pin-to-Window** to detach the extension into its own window (B, 720×1000), place A + B side-by-side, and let the run finish — do not switch the Cardmarket tab, do not minimize window B, do not interact with Cardmarket anywhere else until done. Service-Worker migration planned for v2.2.
- **Want-Lists Bulk-Delete endpoint** is based on the most likely Cardmarket pattern (`POST /Wants/EditWantsList/{id}` with `action=remove`). If your account uses a different flow, please file an issue with a DevTools network-trace of a manual delete.
- **Fast Mode** assumes the form's `action` URL accepts the same FormData payload as the Bootstrap modal submit. Auto-fallback to modal-flow on any error keeps the run safe, but if you see consistently high fallback counts, switch off Fast Mode and report the response status.
- **Cascading Filter language IDs** cover IDs 1-12 (DE, EN, FR, ES, IT, S-CN, JP, KO, RU, PT + buffer). New Cardmarket languages added later may need a manifest bump.

### Acknowledgements
